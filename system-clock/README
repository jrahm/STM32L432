This is much more complex than the simple hello script, but most is boiler plate
designed to make future debugging easier. The first addition is a genmake
system where a Makefile may be generated with the command
`./genmake.pl > Makefile` and subsequently with `make genmake`. This will add
build rules for each `c` file.

There are some added features as well:

* This code loads values properly from the data and bss segments into memory so
  global variables and global constants may be used.

* This code can properly set the system clock, and does get a full 80MHz out
  of it.

* This code has a `spin()` function that flashes a "morse code" translation
  of a binary error code. (1's are dashes, 0's are dots). Gives minimal feedback
  until such a time where USART is implemented.
