Welcome to Level 1
------------------

This is a VERY simple program for the STM32L432 Nucleo-32 board. It simply
iterates turning on the status led (LD3) and the pin D6.

There is NO clock setting or anything, everything is the default bootup.

There is a single source file, main.c, which defines all the code needed.

There is a linker script which sets up the binary format properly ready to
be flashed.

This code can be flashed with

  $ make flash

this requires the program `st-flash` which is a part of the stlink programmer,
which can be found at https://github.com/texane/stlink.git.
